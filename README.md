# Julia Type Instability Bug
This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Julia related to type instability in conditional logic. The bug arises when the input to a function that performs conditional logic exhibits type instability, leading to unexpected results. This is a common error for developers new to Julia, and understanding the root cause and how to effectively mitigate it is crucial.  The solution illustrates the best practices to avoid this behavior and ensure type stability in your Julia code.
